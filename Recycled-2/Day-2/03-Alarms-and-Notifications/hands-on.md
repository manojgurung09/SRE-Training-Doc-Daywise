* Create an **alarm** for CPU usage on the Compute instance running the BharatMart application
* Configure an **email notification channel** so alarms can send alerts

This mirrors real SRE workflows where alerts detect unhealthy system behavior (e.g., CPU spikes from peak shopping traffic on BharatMart).


## 1. Objective of This Hands-On

By completing this exercise, students will:

* Understand how OCI alarms work
* Configure triggers for CPU usage
* Set up an email notification topic
* Attach the topic to the alarm
* Validate that the alarm is active

This prepares learners for SLO-based alerting and incident response in later sessions.


## 2. Task 1 — Create an Alarm for CPU Usage

## **Purpose:** Monitor CPU load of the Compute instance running the BharatMart application.

This ensures you are alerted when the BharatMart API becomes overloaded due to high traffic during peak shopping hours.


## Steps:

1. Open the **Navigation Menu (☰)**.
2. Go to **Observability & Management → Alarms**.
3. Click **Create Alarm**.
4. Fill the fields:

   * **Name:** `<student-id>-cpu-alarm`
   * **Compartment:** Select your training compartment.
5. Under **Alarm Query**, choose:

   * **Metric Namespace:** `oci_computeagent`
   * **Metric Name:** `CpuUtilization`
   * **Resource:** Select your instance: `<student-id>-compute-training`
6. Choose trigger settings:

   * **Statistic:** `Mean`
   * **Operator:** `Greater than`
   * **Threshold:** `70`
   * **Trigger Delay:** `1 minute`
7. Set **Severity:** `Warning` (or `Critical` if desired).
8. Scroll down and leave **Notifications** empty for now (we add the email channel next).
9. Click **Create Alarm**.


## What You Should See:

* Alarm appears in the list
* Status: **`OK`** (normal)
* Query correctly references `CpuUtilization`

Once CPU exceeds 70% for 1 minute, the alarm will enter **`FIRING`** state.


## 3. Task 2 — Add an Email Notification Channel

## **Purpose:** Set up a path for alerts to reach you.

Notifications in OCI use the **Notifications Service**, which relies on **Topics** and **Subscriptions**.


## Steps:

### A. Create a Topic

1. Open **Navigation Menu → Application Integration → Notifications**.
2. Click **Topics**.
3. Click **Create Topic**.
4. Name the topic:

   * `<student-id>-cpu-topic`
5. Click **Create**.


### B. Add an Email Subscription

1. Open the topic you just created.
2. Click **Create Subscription**.
3. Choose:

   * **Protocol:** `Email`
   * **Endpoint:** your email ID
4. Click **Create**.
5. Check your email inbox and **confirm the subscription**.

(If you don’t confirm, you will NOT receive alarm notifications.)


### C. Attach the Notification Topic to Your Alarm

1. Return to **Observability & Management → Alarms**.
2. Click your alarm name: `<student-id>-cpu-alarm`.
3. Click **Edit Alarm**.
4. Under **Notifications**, choose the topic:

   * `<student-id>-cpu-topic`
5. Save changes.


## What You Should See:

* Alarm now lists **1 Notification Channel**
* Topic is active
* Subscription is confirmed

Your alarm is now fully functional.

If CPU crosses 70%, you will receive an email alert.


## 4. Summary of the Hands-On

In this lab you learned how to:

* Monitor the Compute VM hosting the BharatMart Application
* Create a CPU alarm using default OCI metrics
* Configure an email notification channel via Topics and Subscriptions
* Attach notifications to the alarm

This is the foundation for SRE alerting workflows.


## 5. Solutions Key (Instructor Reference)

Use this to verify student work.


## ✔ Solution Key — Task 1: CPU Alarm

### Expected alarm settings:

* **Name:** `<student-id>-cpu-alarm`
* **Namespace:** `oci_computeagent`
* **Metric Name:** `CpuUtilization`
* **Resource:** `<student-id>-compute-training`
* **Threshold:** `> 70%`
* **Delay:** `1 minute`
* **Severity:** `Warning` (acceptable: Critical)

### Expected results:

* Alarm status = **OK** initially
* Query correctly displays in preview


## ✔ Solution Key — Task 2: Email Notification Channel

### Topic:

* **Name:** `<student-id>-cpu-topic`

### Subscription:

* **Protocol:** Email
* **Status:** *Confirmed*

### Alarm configuration:

* Alarm now includes **notification topic**
* Email address verified

### Expected outcome:

* A test spike over 70% CPU triggers an email
