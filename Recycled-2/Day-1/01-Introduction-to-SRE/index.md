# Day 1 – SRE Fundamentals and OCI Foundations

## Topic 1: Introduction to SRE

---

## 1. Concept Overview

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline focused on ensuring that systems run reliably, predictably, and at scale. It brings together principles from software engineering and infrastructure operations to remove uncertainty from production environments.

For IT engineers and developers, SRE can be summarized as:

* A way to engineer system reliability, rather than "manage" it.
* A structured approach to measure, improve, and automate system behaviour.
* A discipline that ensures the code you write or deploy behaves correctly under real workloads.
* A method to understand how applications behave under stress, failure, and unpredictable user patterns.

SRE is not a support function. It is an engineering role focused on system design, measurement, automation, and operational excellence.

## 2. How This Applies to IT Engineers and Developers

### For IT Engineers

* SRE provides structured tools and practices to reduce repetitive operational tasks.
* It clarifies how availability, latency, monitoring, and scaling should be engineered.
* Helps shift from:

  * Manual deployments → Automated CI/CD
  * Reactive troubleshooting → Proactive observability
  * Ad-hoc scripts → Standardised automation
  * Ticket-driven work → Measurable engineering improvements

### For Developers

* SRE helps developers understand how their code behaves in real-world conditions.
* Ensures that the application is:

  * Observable
  * Measurable
  * Fault-tolerant
  * Scalable
* Helps answer:

  * What happens to my API when concurrency increases?
  * What happens when a downstream dependency slows?
  * What metrics prove that my feature is working correctly?

### Developer ↔ IT Engineer ↔ SRE Relationship

```
Developer: Build the feature  
IT Engineer: Deploy and support the environment  
SRE: Ensure the entire system meets reliability targets
```

## 3. Key Principles

### Reliability Must Be Measured

SRE defines reliability through SLIs (metrics) and SLOs (targets), removing subjectivity.

### Automate Repetitive Work

Manual operations increase error risk; automation ensures consistency.

### Systems Must Be Observable

Logs, metrics, and traces allow engineers to understand behaviour, troubleshoot, and improve systems.

#### BharatMart Implementation

The platform implements all three pillars of observability:

```
BharatMart Application (Express.js API)
  | \
  |  \
 Logs Metrics Traces
  |    |       |
  v    v       v
Winston  Prometheus  OpenTelemetry
  |         |            |
  v         v            v
logs/    /metrics     OTLP Endpoint
api.log  endpoint      (optional)
```

#### Key Observability Features
- **Metrics:** Prometheus metrics exposed at `/metrics` endpoint
- **Metrics Middleware:** Automatic request tracking and latency measurement
- **Logging:** Structured JSON logging via Winston logger
- **Tracing:** Optional distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry

### Design for Failure

Systems should continue functioning even when components degrade.

### Controlled Change Management

SRE ensures safe rollouts using strategies such as canary deployments and feature flags.

### Blameless Learning Culture

Learning from incidents without individual blame.

## 4. Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — API Latency Spikes in BharatMart

**Scenario:** A new checkout feature increases API execution time.

* **Developer's Perspective:** Sees a need to optimise code for better performance.
* **SRE's Perspective:** Sees a P99 latency breach impacting user experience and potential revenue loss.

#### How BharatMart Demonstrates This

The platform includes built-in latency monitoring through Prometheus metrics:

- Every API request is automatically tracked for duration
- Metrics are exposed at `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format
- Key metric: `http_request_duration_seconds` - tracks all request latencies

#### SRE Actions in BharatMart

1. **Track latency SLIs** - Access metrics endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/metrics`
2. **Visualise P95/P99 spikes** - Query Prometheus for percentile distributions
3. **Work with developers** - Share metrics data to identify slow code paths
4. **Monitor continuously** - Set up alerts when P99 exceeds threshold (e.g., > 500ms)

### Example 2 — OCI Compute Instance Degradation

**Scenario:** An OCI VM running BharatMart slows down and becomes temporarily unresponsive.

* **IT Engineer's Action:** Restarts the instance, but the issue reappears.
* **SRE's Investigation:** Uses observability to find root cause.

#### How BharatMart Demonstrates This

The platform generates comprehensive metrics that would help identify the issue:

1. **HTTP Request Metrics** - Detecting slow API responses
   - `http_requests_total{status_code="500"}` - Server errors
   - `http_request_duration_seconds` - Response time degradation

2. **Application Logs** - Structured JSON logs for debugging

   BharatMart generates structured JSON logs with rich context. Example log entry:

   ```json
   {
     "coldStart": false,
     "environment": "development",
     "eventType": "api_request",
     "level": "error",
     "message": "API Request",
     "method": "GET",
     "path": "/api/orders",
     "response_time_ms": 5000,
     "service": "sre-training-platform",
     "span_id": "6312faf92861776b",
     "status_code": 500,
     "timestamp": "2025-11-30 16:49:50",
     "trace_id": "087fdc86277e500e32990e3ba6f77966"
   }
   ```

   These logs include OpenTelemetry tracing fields (`trace_id`, `span_id`) for distributed tracing correlation and can be ingested into OCI Logging Service.

3. **Business Metrics** - Impact on user transactions
   - `orders_failed_total` - Failed orders due to system issues
   - `payments_processed_total{status="failed"}` - Payment failures

#### SRE Actions in BharatMart

1. **Review metrics** - Check `/metrics` endpoint for error rates and latency spikes
2. **Analyze logs** - Review `logs/api.log` for error patterns and stack traces
3. **Identify root cause** - Correlate metrics (high latency) with logs (database connection pool exhaustion)
4. **Implement monitoring** - Set up Prometheus alerts for error rate thresholds
5. **Document solution** - Create runbook for similar incidents

### Example 3 — Observability in Action (BharatMart Platform)

**Scenario:** Understanding the three pillars of observability through BharatMart.

**BharatMart implements all three observability pillars:**

1. **Metrics (Prometheus)**

    - Endpoint: `GET /metrics`
    - HTTP metrics, business metrics (orders, payments)

2. **Logs (Winston)**

    - Structured JSON logging with rich context
    - File: `logs/api.log` (can be ingested into OCI Logging Service)
    - Request/response logging with OpenTelemetry trace IDs
    - Error logs with stack traces
    - Business event logs (orders, payments)
    - Includes fields: `trace_id`, `span_id`, `eventType`, `response_time_ms`, etc.

3. **Traces (OpenTelemetry)**

    - Optional distributed tracing via OTLP
    - Request correlation across services

**How This Demonstrates SRE Principles:**

```
BharatMart Application
  | \
  |  \
Logs Metrics Traces
  |    |       |
  v    v       v
Observability Platform --> SRE Action
```

This architecture allows SREs to:
- **Measure** system behavior quantitatively (metrics)
- **Understand** what happened (logs)
- **Trace** request flow across components (traces)
- **Take action** based on data, not guesswork


## 4. Additional Notes

* SRE becomes most effective when integrated early in design and development cycles.
* IT engineers and developers benefit significantly from adopting SRE thinking.
